                <h2>
                    Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has far-reaching consequences for spaceflight and the international space community.

                    As the tragedy of the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfolds on the ground, the international space community has been watching the repercussions for spaceflight. While much is still uncertain, here are the major impacts on space that have occurred or been announced over the past week.
                </p>

                <h3>IMPACT ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION</h3>

                <p>
                    The most immediate impact is on the International Space Station (ISS), which has continuously hosted crew from the U.S., Russia, Europe, and Japan since November 2000. The current crew includes one astronaut from the European Space Agency (ESA), four from NASA, and two from Russia's Roscomos.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So far, near-term arrivals and departures to and from the ISS will go on as planned, including the planned arrival of Soyuz MS-20 with an three Russian cosmonauts, launching on March 18th. A planned departure of Soyuz MS-19, currently docked on the ISS, will take NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei back to Earth on March 30th.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Certainly, we’re in a better position than during Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, when the Soyuz was the only ride crew could take to and from the station. Now, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is available for that purpose. (Boeing's Starliner might also be available soon, too, though it still needs to undergo a successful test flight this spring.)
